Project Title: 3.07 Accepting User Input
Purpose of Project: To adapt the GradesV2 project to accept
                    user input and return information based
                    on that input.

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to learn the difference between the next and nextLine methods
      It was simpler and cleaner than GradesV2

<-s>: It was difficult to adapt to the new methods at first
      I encountered many syntax errors before getting it right
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, it may be beneficial to adapt the program
                     with new methods and optimizations to increase the use-
                     ability of the program. Perhaps a GUI would help to create
                     a more user-friendly experience.
