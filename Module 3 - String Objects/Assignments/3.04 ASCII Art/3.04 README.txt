==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: Able to learn how to use the string class quickly
      Had fun making art
      Didn't have much confusion with strings

<-s>: Sometimes confused "\\" escape sequence with just "\"
      Had to do some fiddling around to get art to display properly
=======================================

Future Improvements:
For the future, I will now be more familiar with escape
sequences and can perhaps create more creative works of art
by use of ASCII, the print() function, and String literals.
