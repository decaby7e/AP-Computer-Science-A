Project Title: 3.09 Online Purchase
Purpose of Project: To review all content that was taught in module 3 and
                    implement said content in a single program that take in
                    input, performs computations and reformats it, and then out-
                    put that data to the user.

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively implement a wide variety of techniques learned
      in module 3
      Syntax errors were rare

<-s>: I was not able to implement every learned method, although most were used
      Formatting was difficult to perfect
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, the use of logical operators in this program
                     may help to circumvent it's fragility, due to the volatile
                     nature of assuming user input to be perfect.
