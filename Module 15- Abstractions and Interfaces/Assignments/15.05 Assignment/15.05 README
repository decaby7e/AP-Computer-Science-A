==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: This was fun to program and challenged me
	    Took a while but was very good for review

<-s>: Had frequent errors relating to types but time helped me see the solutions

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Become more comfortable with the topics learned in this module as a whole
	 and how I can implement them in my own day-to-day programming
