==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: The errors that I ran into were simple to fix
	    The use of shapes makes this concept easier to understand

<-s>: It was different than other OOP concepts
      I was confused when I had to compare 3D shapes to other 3D shapes rather than rectangles
      as well as I had before. (Understood very well after a few error messages)

======================================

Future Improvements:
Become more familiar and natural with overriding and using it in my code
