==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I enjoyed making this from scratch, as it allowed me to organize it better
      than the previous ElectionTester assignments
      Using the skills from the past assignments, I completed this assignment with
      minimal errors

<-s>: Arrays can get messy to work with sometimes
      The code was getting rather bloated towards completion

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Possibly condense this program into several separate programs that have general
   methods for the reviewed algorithms like I would like to in the past assignments
   and also try using ArrayLists instead.
