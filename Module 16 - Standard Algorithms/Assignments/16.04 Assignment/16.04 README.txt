==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: This was fun to program and challenged me
	    I was able to move quickly between arrays and ArrayLists like I had in
      previous assignments with algorithms

<-s>: It was tedious adding checks for null objects while adding a removal method

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Possibly condense this program into several separate programs that have general
   methods for the reviewed algorithms
