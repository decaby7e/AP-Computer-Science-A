==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively implement error checking
      The printf syntax was very useful

<-s>: I made mistakes with printf at first
      The program had lots of syntax errors at first
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I think it would be interesting to implement
                     the ability to input custom weather information and maybe
                     even a GUI for it.
