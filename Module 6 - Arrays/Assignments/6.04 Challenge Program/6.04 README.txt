Project Title: 6.04 Challenge Program
Purpose of Project: To take information about hurricanes from 1995 to 2015, with the range depending on the
                    user's input, and output that information in order along with some information on
                    counts and statistics.

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to correctly implement and check the functionality of all aspects
      of the program
      There were no visible errors or glitches in the final product

<-s>: I struggled greatly on perfecting the user defined range of years, as it was
      difficult to do so with several hurricanes being found in a specific year
      The code is very long
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I could improve the appearance of both the code
                     itself and the user output to make it easier to read and
                     reprogram. I could also optimize the code to make it more
                     efficient.
