1. What difficulties did you run into writing the frequency analysis program? How did you resolve these problems?
2. How closely did the frequencies of letters in the plaintext and the ciphertext correspond? What could be done to improve the accuracy of the correspondence?
3. This assignment involved writing a program and then interpreting the results the old fashioned way. Propose an extension to this project that would allow the computer to do all the work so that you only have to evaluate whether the decoded message makes senses. You don’t need to actually write another program to do this, just consider how it could be done and clearly describe your solution in a well-written paragraph.
