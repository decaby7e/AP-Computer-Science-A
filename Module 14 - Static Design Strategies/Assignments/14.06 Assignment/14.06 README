==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: This was fun to program and challenged me
	    I was able to use try/catch for my input, which I learned in Python first

<-s>: It was tricky figuring out how to deduce an algorithm for finding primes
======================================

Future Improvements:
   Become more comfortable with object oriented approaches to these kinds of
   challenges and make my code as efficient as possible
