==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to understand more intuitively how to think recursively
	    I also was able to make this into an app for Android

<-s>: It was much different than other recursive cases I had completed before, throwing me off a bit
	    It's been a while since I've programmed a Java application
======================================

Future Improvements:
Become more familiar and natural with implementing recursive logic
