Project Title: 9.04 Catapult Trajectory
Purpose of Project: To calculate the trajectory of a projectile based on launch angles and launch
                    velocities using a matrix of values for the storage of calculated values

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to successfully implement a matrix into my program
      The code is concise and easy to understand

<-s>: It was tricky getting used to traversing matricies
      It took a while for me to think of using vectors to store speed and angle
      values
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to add more methods to the class
                     and add more output variables to make the program more useful.
