==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: It was easy to use 'if' and 'else' and 'else if' statements
	  The use of conditional operators made the code more concise

<-s>: I sometimes forgot semicolons
	  I initially tried parsing everything, but it proved to be very time consuming
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, to improve this program, the use of parsing
					 to prevent user error and premature program termination
					 would be tremendously helpful. Another potential improve-
					 ment would be to optimize the code to use the least
					 ammount of code as possible.
