Project Title: 8.12 Challenge Program
Purpose of Project: The purpose of this program is to approximate pi using the Monte Carlo method
                    through the use of object oriented programming

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively calculate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo
      method
      I was able to effectively translate this existing code into one that utilizes
      object oriented programming

<-s>: The code would become very messy at times
      Getting the output just right was very tedious
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to clean up the code quite a
                     bit and perform some optimization on it to ensure the best
                     possible operation and functionality
