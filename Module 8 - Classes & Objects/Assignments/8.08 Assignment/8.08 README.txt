Project Title:alot of the process
Purpose of Project:

Author(s): Jack Polk

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: The array really simplified the coding process
      The statistics came out exactly how I wanted it

<-s>: The main method in the tester class is rather bulky
      I was having issues with determining the best way to organize my code
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to cut the main method down
                     quite a bit and also use object arrays in more programs
