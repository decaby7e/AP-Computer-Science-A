==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: The output formatted nicely
      It didn't take too long to program

<-s>: I had difficulty with using the dataRecord object at first
      Perfecting the output was tedious
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, it would be nice to implement this same use
                     of ArrayLists with other programs to make the process of
                     coding much easier.
