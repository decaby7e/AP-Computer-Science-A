Project Title: 8.09 Assignments
Purpose of Project: To test Javadocs implementation
Version: 4/16/18
Author(s): Jack Polk

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to thoroughly document my code
      The syntax of Javadocs is easy to understand

<-s>: I couldn't get my program to correctly detect the documentation at first
      Generating Javadoc HTML files is tricky on my platform (Atom)
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to be able to add more detailed
                     comments to my code to further document its purpose and
                     perhaps implement this into my already-made programs
