==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to convert my original program, CatV3, into cat CatV7 successfully
      The CatV7 class is concise and clear to understand

<-s>: It took referencing the lesson to be able to translate my prior program to the
      new format
      There is many variables in the test class
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I could possibly add more methods and make
                     the program more interactive to make the object seem more
                     "realistic."
