Project Title: 7.05 Challenge Program
Purpose of Project: The purpose of this program is to approximate pi using the
                    Monte Carlo method

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively calculate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo
      method
      The code is evenly split into functional methods

<-s>: It was difficult to grasp the concept at first
      The code is slow while only calculating a few digits of pi
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, it would be better to use a more efficient
                     method than the Monte Carlo method and there could be
                     optimizations made to the existing code
