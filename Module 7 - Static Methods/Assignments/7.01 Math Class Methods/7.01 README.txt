==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to quickly complete this program
      I was able to implement error catching loops

<-s>: I could not figure out at one point why my program would not exit
      a while loop
      It took some time to perfect everything
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I could implement a function that allows the user
                     to input their own equation of a circle
