Project Title: 7 Defining New Methods
Purpose of Project: To calculate the different surface gravities of different
                    planets and to calculate the weight of a person on all of
                    these planets.

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively integrate both programs together
      The formatting on each looks great

<-s>: It was tricky figuring out how to split each program's methods
      I had difficulty at first with the formatting of the output
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, it would be nice to optimize the programs
                     and perhaps pipe the information from one directly into
                     the other rather than use a text file as a medium between
                     the two.
