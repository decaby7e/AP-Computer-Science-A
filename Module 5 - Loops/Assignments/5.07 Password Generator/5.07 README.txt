Project Title: 5.07 Password Generator
Purpose of Project: To generate random passwords that are at least 6 characters in length
                    with different variations, all based on user input, and output these
                    passwords to a text file, which is then read back to the user through
                    the terminal.

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively accomplish my goal
      I used plenty of variables to make sure that the program was flexible and
      able to adapt to future changes

<-s>: It was hard to implement all the different techniques I have learned up to
      this point in a single program
      I had issues with figuring out how to correctly pick ASCII values using
      conditional operators
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I could add more options to make the program
                     more useful and perhaps even add a GUI.
