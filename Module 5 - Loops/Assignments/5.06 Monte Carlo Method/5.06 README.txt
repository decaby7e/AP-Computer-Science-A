Purpose of Project: The purpose of this program is to use the Monte Carlo
                    sampling method to determine how many fish an individual
                    may observe before seeing a snapper out of a sample greater
                    than or equal to 1000 fish

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to implement most of what I have learned up to this point
      I added variables to make the program more dynamic; user modifiability
      could be possible in the future
<-s>: Getting used to the nested loops was tricky
      Organizing my code became tricky as well; it was hard to keep track of
      everything
======================================

Future Improvements: To make this program better in the future, I believe that
                     the implementation of user input in determining the species,
                     specific breed, probability, and more would help to increase
                     diversity in applications.
