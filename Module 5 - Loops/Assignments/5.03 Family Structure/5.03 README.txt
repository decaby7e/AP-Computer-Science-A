==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: Very quick and concise program
      Easy to implement required tasks;
      Simple arithmetic

<-s>: Forgetting to cast in calculations of probability caused percentages to output as 0 at first
      Hard to clearly define variables at first
======================================

Future Improvements: In the future, I believe the implementation of some
                     type of user interface to selecting other text files
                     would vastly expand the usability of this program.
                     The same concept could also be applied to more
                     complex calculations.
