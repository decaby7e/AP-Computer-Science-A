==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: Java syntax was easy to adapt to
      The high level of the language makes development and compiling easy
      Functions were easy to memorize

<-s>: I frequently went back to other programming languages and typed in incorrect syntax
      The IDE was much different from those I had previously used
======================================

Future Improvements: I will continue to memorize the syntax of Java to effectively implement new ideas into code.
I still need to work on getting used to the development environment of Java, as I am used to C++ and Python. I
don't believe it will be too difficult, as it is a higher level than those that I have used before and should not
be too much different from Python in my opinion.
