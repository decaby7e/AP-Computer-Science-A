Project Title: 17.04 Assignment
Purpose of Project: To demonstrate an understanding of merge sorting by use
                    of Movie arrays with years, names, and studios for sorting
                    parameters

==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to understand this algorithm better than the others
      I was able to create an effective method for reusing some methods

<-s>: Getting used to this concept is tricky
      Merge sorting is extremely complex compared to the other sorting types

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Create a more elegant implementation of the concept for this code and write
   my own implementation of this algorithm for a better understanding of the
   concept
