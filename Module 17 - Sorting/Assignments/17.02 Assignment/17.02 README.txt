==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I felt satisfied after understanding the mechanism behind the insertion sort

<-s>: Getting used to this concept is tricky
      Very time consuming
      Could be more elegantly implemented

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Create a more elegant and personally appealing algorithm for insertion sorting
   that I understand more comfortably.
