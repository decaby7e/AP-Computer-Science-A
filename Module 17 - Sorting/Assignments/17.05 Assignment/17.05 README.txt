==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to effectively translate past learned algorithms into this code
      There was minimal errors

<-s>: Some errors when going from arrays to ArrayLists
      Merge sorting is extremely complex compared to the other sorting types

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Create a more elegant implementation of the concept for this code and write
   my own implementation of these algorithms for a better understanding of the
   concept
