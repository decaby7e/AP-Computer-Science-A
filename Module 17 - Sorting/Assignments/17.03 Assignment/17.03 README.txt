==========Post Mortem Review==========
<+s>: I was able to understand this algorithm better than the others
      Coding this only took around half an hour and was simple to change the old
      code to this

<-s>: Getting used to this concept is tricky
      Code is still not as ideal as I would like for it to be

======================================

Future Improvements:
   Create a more elegant implementation of the concept for this code and write
   my own implementation of this algorithm for a better understanding of the
   concept
